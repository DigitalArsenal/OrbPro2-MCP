## CRITICAL: File System Boundaries

**NEVER modify files outside this repository.**

- Only read/write/edit files within `/Users/tj/software/OrbPro-Small-Language-Model/`
- You may READ files in sibling directories for reference
- You must NEVER WRITE or EDIT files outside this repository
- If asked to update documentation in other repos, inform the user and provide the content for them to apply manually

## Key Directories

- `/src` - TypeScript source code
- `/packages/mcp-server-cpp` - C++/WASM MCP server
- `/training` - LLM training data and scripts

Create and train a small language model that can be run using WebGPU in the browser that takes plain text commands and controls CesiumJS. Use https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/genai/llm_inference/web_js as reference, do not be afraid to look up additional resources. Create an MCP that can be compiled to WebAssembly to also run in the browser using CesiumJS documentation and the CZML documentation, and a front-end that can take plain text queries and do things with it. Download anything you need to do this. --max-iterations=1000 --completion-promise=Cesium SLM Finished
